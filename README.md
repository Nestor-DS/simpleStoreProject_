# Simple Store Project

This is a simple project of a store where the use of a credit card to make purchases is simulated. The application prompts the user to enter the credit limit of the card. Then, in a loop, it asks the user to enter the description and value of each purchase he/she wants to make. The purchase is made if the card balance is sufficient, otherwise, an insufficient balance message is displayed and the program terminates. After each purchase, the user is asked if he/she wishes to make another purchase or exit. At the end, a summary of all purchases made is displayed, sorted by value, along with the remaining card balance.
